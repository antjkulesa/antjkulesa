- 👋 Hi, I’m Anthony Kulesa (@antjkulesa)
- 👀 I’m interested in programming different languages and SQL/database solutions. I used to be a filemaker database developer for an EMR/EHR solution leading the Patient Accounts section. I also created an idle game in unity with C#.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Rust, Sql, and brushing up on C#.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can make use of what skills I am learning.
- 📫 How to reach me:
